                The Parliament of Sierra Leone enacted the NYS Act and gazette as 
                Vol. CXLV11. No. 17 dated 12 March 2016. Sierra Leoneâ€™s NYS, which was launched in December 
                2016, is a national programme that promotes youth participation in governance.
                    <br><br>
                          The 2016 NYS Act aims to create work opportunities and sustainable
                          livelihoods for young persons; instill in participants a sense of responsibility 
                          and of service to the country; gain a sense of self-respect and respect for authority; 
                          understand the values of discipline, democracy, citizenship and cooperation;
                           and foster social cohesion.
                     <br><br>
                          The National Youth Service (NYS) Framework, the study that led to the development of 
                          NYS Act of 2016, recognizes the role of the NYS in the social 
                          mobilization and capacity-building of the youth.
                    <br><br>
                     <b>The NYS Framework states that youth service initiatives should broadly encompass the following:</b>
                    <br>
                      <li>Develop skills, knowledge and the ability to make a better transition into adulthood;</li>
                      <li>Provide a vehicle for national development in different areas of deployment;</li>
                      <li>Introduce capacity-building programmes for leadership;</li>
                      <li>Facilitate youth-driven poverty alleviation programmes;</li>
                      <li>Make community service an integral part of tertiary education and the school curriculum and expand it to reach community service needs;</li>
                      <li>Create a spirit of nationalism and patriotism among the youth population, thereby helping to eliminate prejudices about fellow citizens of Sierra Leone.</li>
